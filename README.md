**How does the challenge work?**

* In the first 2 weeks, you’ll receive hands-on assignments delivered to your inbox. 
  * The goal of these assignments is to rapidly cover the most essential skills needed to get your hands dirty with data. 
  * You'll start by learning how to code in Python and quickly learn how to build your first machine learning model.
* After tackling these core concepts, you’ll be invited to a super fun, beginner-friendly Kaggle machine learning competition to test your knowledge. 
  * Through practice, you’ll explore the best ways to use Kaggle as a learning resource and connect with other data scientists.
* On top of all of this, you’ll have the opportunity to attend elective workshops and seminars hosted by data scientists from Google's Developer Experts Program.
